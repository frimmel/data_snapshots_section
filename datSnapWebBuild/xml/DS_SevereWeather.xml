			<questOne><![CDATA[<font size="2"><b><i>Where is severe weather likely at this time of year?</i></b></font><p>Shading on the map reflects how often severe weather occurred within 25 miles during a 30-year base period. The darker the shading, the larger the number of severe weather events that occured near that date. Severe weather encompasses tornadoes, winds over 58 miles per hour, and hail larger than three-quarters of an inch in diameter.</p>]]></questOne>
			<questTwo><![CDATA[<font size="2"><b><i>How were these maps produced?</i></b></font><p>For each day of the year, scientists plotted all severe weather events that occurred from 1982 to 2011 on a gridded map. To reveal the long-term patterns of these events, they applied mathematical filters to smooth the counts in time and space. Keep in mind that severe weather is possible at any location on any day of the year.</p>]]></questTwo>
